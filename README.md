# Snake Free Movement
> After developing two sanke mini games, I challenged my self on a new movement type project

This project is still in beta development
    * The first proper release

🐍 Put your reflexes to the test with this classic Snake game created in JavaScript Canvas. Navigate a maze, gobble up apples, and avoid your own growing tail as the game speed increases with each bite. Can you master the challenge and achieve the highest score? 🍎
